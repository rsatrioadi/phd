### Role stereotype classifiers

[↑ back](/README.md)

Our journal paper [Role stereotypes in software designs and their evolution (JSS vol.189)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2022.111296) describes our effort to classify (Java) classes into role stereotypes. But first: **Role stereotypes** are abstract characterisations of the responsibilities of the building blocks of software applications. The role a class plays within a software system reflects its design intention. [Rebecca Wirfs-Brock](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q967529) introduced the following six role stereotypes: **_Information Holder_**, which knows information; **_Structurer_**, which maintains object relationships; **_Service Provider_**, which offers computing services; **_Coordinator_**, which delegates tasks to others; **_Controller_**, which directs other’s actions; and **_Interfacer_**, which transforms information. While these stereotypes were introduced in a “forward” way during design, we instead apply this notion retroactively—given the source code of a class, which role stereotype best describes it?

The original classifier was constructed by performing machine learning on static features of the class' source code. In his master's thesis, [Ka Yip Fung](../../../../Mboopi) improved the accuracy of the classifier by including dynamic features acquired by the means of run-time profiling. He extracted the features based on the call tree generated by [JProfiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html).

We believe role stereotype information can be used to fine-tune smell detections. For example, the threshold of how many attributes a class should have must be different between an Information Holder and a Service Provider. This remains an open research question for now.
