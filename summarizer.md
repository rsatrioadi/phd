### Software component summarization

[â†‘ back](/README.md)

In [Achieving High-Level Software Component Summarization via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Static Code Analysis (ICoDSE'23)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoDSE59534.2023.10292037) we presented an approach for automated software component summarization, combining static analysis with the emerging capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM). In short, we use LLM to generate summaries of individual Java methods from their source code and then gather the summaries of all methods under a class to then generate a summary of that class. Analogously, we gather the summaries of all classes under a package to then generate a summary of that package.

(In the figure, _operation_ is synonymous with _method_, _module_ with _class_, and _component_ with _package_.)

A showcase for this technique is shown [here](/jhotdraw-summaries.md). Everything in that page is generated from pure source code, i.e., discarding any sorts of comments. An evaluation for this technique is currently being planned.
