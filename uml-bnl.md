### UML or Box-and-Line?

Diagrams can be a way that a software system is presented. UML was promoted to be the standard way to depict software systems, however we also find that non-standardized practice is widespread in software eingineering, in the form of what we call box-and-line (B&L) diagrams. Therefore, we explore the questions:

- Is either UML or B&L diagram better than the other at conveying software architecture design?
    - Which aspects of software architecture design are better communicated using either type of diagram?
    - What is the difference, if any, in the cognitive load involved in the task of comprehending software architecture design using the two types of diagram?
 
We have an ongoing study involving comprehension tasks using the two types of diagram. The result of this study may then lead to the type of knowledge presentation that we will generate as a part of software architecture explanation.
