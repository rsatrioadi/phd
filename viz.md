#### Visualization efforts

One way that knowledge can be presented is trough (interactive) visualization. We have a visualization tool that takes as input the JSON-formatted LPG. It is developed using the Cytoscape javascript library. It is live and can be interacted with [here](https://rsatrioadi.github.io/classviz/?p=jhotdraw-trc-sum-rs).

Currently, we are actively developing visualization tools to help software developers understand the structure of a complex software system. We are focusing on having two levels of abstractions: a high level that should display something like 15 to 20 abstract “components” that we can use to zoom-in (and zoom back out) to a more detailed level.
